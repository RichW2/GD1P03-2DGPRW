Thank you for marking my paint tool.

The toolbar contains no text, for the reasons of i didnt want to figure out how to use it, and because it means anyone of any language can use this program.
The save functionality has been left in, it does not work for me, but maybe it works for you?
Because the save funtion does not work for me, the load function only loads in 1 picture i made. Replace this picture with another of the same name to load your own.
This picture is found in /Saves/SavedImage.png

You could also just use windows' Snipping Tool, take a picture of your canvas and put it into /Saves with the correct name (loadthis.png), then press the load button.

Program starts with an image i created, took a snipping tool of and renamed to "loadthis.png". You can load this image in.
Click the buttons on the left tool window to change your brush, clear the screen or activate rainbow mode.
control + z is a shortcut to undo.
control + p is a shortcut for the colour picker.
you cannot draw over shapes.
There is a max and min for both brush size and polygon sides.
